Digital PSU

This originally started life as the revision B EEVBlog power supply project, but I have made several changes to my version of the design. The first revision of ym design was pretty much a carbon copy of the EEVBlog design, but removed the USB jack and the micro current section. The board was designed with all through-hole components, except for the components that only come in SMD packages, and as a result, was larger and more expensive to produce. The new version, however, only uses through-hole versions of the DAC, ADC, op-amps, the LT3080, and a couple filter capacitors. Instead of using an atmega328 now, it uses an Xmega A4, both for speed and for I/O count. Also changed are the elimination of the push-buttons and MCP23008 I/O expanders.

Key Features:
	-Xmega A4 simplifies design by eliminating need for I/O expansion
	-LT3080 as main output regulator
	-MCP4922 digital-to-analog converter
	-MCP3204 analog-to-digital converter
	-MAX4080F for current sensing
	-Easily readible OLED display
	-Intuitive menu system for set-up and calibration
