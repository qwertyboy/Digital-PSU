Digital PSU

This is a power supply based on the revision B EEVBlog uPSU.

There are a few minor changes, mainly being the removal of a few sections. On this version, the uCurrent and the USB jack have been removed. In addition, the tactile switches have been done away with in favor of just using a pin header to connect external buttons or switches. This allows easier integration with enclosures with built-in buttons/switches. The rotary encoders are still mounted to the board, but one could easily run wires to existing ones.

Key Features:
	-atmega328 - fully compatible with the Arduino IDE - includes FTDI header
	-2 MCP23008's for I/O expansion
	-LT3080 as main output regulator
	-MCP4922 digital-to-analog converter
	-MCP3204 analog-to-digital converter
	-MAX4080F for current sensing
